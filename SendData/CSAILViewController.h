//A. Import GameKit Framework

//B. Subclass GKSessionDelegate and GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate
//      GKSessionDelegate: Used to maintain Sessions
//      GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate: Gives an Apple provided peer picker,
//            where you can look for other devices using the same apps to connect with.
//            For now, we actually won't use this and will implement our own UI elements.
//            This is because we are using a client-server model, which the PeerPickerController does not work with.
//            Why? The client-server model allows â‰¥ 3 connections simultaneously, where as the peer-to-peer model only
//            allows 2 devices to connect at once.

@interface CSAILViewController : UIViewController <GKSessionDelegate, GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate>{
//C. Create the following objects.
    //Connection session.
    GKSession *dataSession;

    //Array of peers connected
    NSMutableArray *dataPeers;
